                <pre>In words he wove both care and might,
A gentle torch, a steady light.
He spoke of paths that one could choose,
To waste, to wander, or to use.

Like tales of Eklavya, old and true,
He taught me reverence, yet courage too.
That seniors guide with hearts so kind,
Their wisdom shapes both soul and mind.

“Be rebel, yes,” his laughter said,
“But not with those who’ve walked ahead.”
And in his voice, I came to see,
Respect and freedom live equally.

Thank you, Gaurav Bhaiya,
For teaching me that rebellion shines brighter with wisdom.</pre>
