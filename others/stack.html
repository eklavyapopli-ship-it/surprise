                <pre>New worlds of code, I longed to see,
But where to start was unclear to me.
Then came Namita Didi, bright and near,
Her voice of tech, a guide sincere.

She showed me stacks, both vast and wide,
MERN and more, with patient pride.
Each layer built, each skill in place,
She opened doors to a broader space.

Her wisdom sparked a boundless fire,
To learn, to build, to reach much higher.
Through her, I found the keys to grow,
In paths of tech Iâ€™d yearned to know.

Thank you, Namita Didi,
For unlocking the stacks that shaped my journey.</pre>
