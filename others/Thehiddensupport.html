                <pre>Not every gift is seen or told,
Some shine in silence, gentle, bold.
In countless ways, both small and deep,
Her care was there, her watch to keep.

Piyusha Didi, a quiet flame,
She cheered me on, without acclaim.
Through unseen paths her kindness ran,
A steady guide, a helping hand.

Though memory fades of every part,
Her presence lives within my heart.
For strength she gave, though soft, unseen,
Made brighter skies where clouds had been.

Thank you, Piyusha Didi,
For your invisible yet invaluable support.</pre>
