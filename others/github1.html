                <pre>I stood before a screen, unsure,
Lost in commands I’d not seen before.
A path of code, but where to start?
I carried doubt within my heart.

Then came Ishaan Bhaiya’s guiding hand,
He helped me patiently, made me understand.
And with his care, he took me near,
To Ria Didi, whose wisdom was clear.

Together they lit my very first flame,
In the world of tech, they carved my name.
Without their light, I might still roam,
But with their guidance, I found my home.

Thank you, Ishaan Bhaiya & Ria Didi,
For being the dawn of my journey’s city.</pre>
